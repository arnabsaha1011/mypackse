## Overview

In Feb project, we tried to identify the potential usability problems of Google applications . To do that a multi-step task was given to 20 users. On completion of the task, the users were asked to fill a survey with five questions. In all, several usability problems were identified and three solutions were suggested. In Mar project, we have implemented the three solutions which solves different subsets of the problems. In addition, we will be asking the users to do the same task using our new applications and try to find out if the users are finding our solutions useful.

## Evaluation Plan

In the next part of our evaluation, we will be present our three solutions to the users and ask them to do the multi-step task again but this time using our products. We will be test on all our previous users and additionally we will be test it on some new users. We will try to find out if the users found our application useful for these kind of task or will they still prefer to use Google applications. We would also ask them to categorize the features in our applications as novel/interesting/useful. Finally we will ask the users to rate which application out of the three was the most useful and collect suggestions as to how the layout, views and functionalities of each of our applications can be improved.
