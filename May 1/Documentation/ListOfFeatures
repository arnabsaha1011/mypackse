Bad Smell:

1. poor budget
    a. Long Open Issue(the design of each phase may not have good boundary)
    b. Short Open Issues(as below)
    c. Issues Missing Milestone Due Date(the design of each phase may be not suitable. Some phase may have a lot of work, but some may have fewer)
    d. Time taken for fixing bugs(if it takes too long, the first design is not good)
    e. Time taken for creating enhancements(if it takes too long, the first design is not good)
    f. Active number of days per repo
    

2. poor team cohesiveness
    a. Issues Without Assignees(they don't know which one to assign or they only work themselves)
    b. Average number of comments per issue(how people follows issue and how they are positive to project)
    c. Number of comments per user(If one is very low, he may be low participation)
    d. Equal number of Issue Assignees(participation)
    e. Equal number of Issues posted by each user(participation)
    f. Number of commits per user
    
3. poor issue usage(make others confused and affect the whole project because github is an important to manage project, be good at github is essential)
    a. Issues Without Milestones
    b. Issues Without Assignees
    
4. poor milestone usage
    a. Issues Without Milestones
    b. Issues Missing Milestone Due Date(the milestone may be not suitable)

5. Dictator(everything is done by one person and every others rely on this person)
    a. Equal number of Issue Assignees
    b. Equal number of Issues posted by each user
    c. Number of comments per user
