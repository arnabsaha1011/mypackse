Clearly define PUTG and try to justify the definition:P(problem): Why simple operations like copying and pasting may cause a problem to users? What are the most common behavior patterns that lead to these problems? What are the problems with existing clipboard managers(In what aspects they need to be improved)?U(user group): What are the targeted users(How to category a user group)? Who are affected most by the problem we mentioned above? What are typical environments and what are the behavior patterns of the targeted users in that particular environment? T(software tools): Eclipse IDE itself is a software tool. What are the features of the IDE? What specific design principles or rules we need to follow when developing the plug-in(How to make it consistent with the platform)? What is possible with the IDE and what may be impractical given the time? What tools are we going to use for the management of the project and why we choose them(Git-Github, shareLatex)?  G(goal): What functions will the plug-in include and what will not? How to define the usability of a clipboard manager? How to prove that our design is really better than other clipboard managers? 2. Data collection:Were the review documents' inclusion and exclusion criteria described and appropriate?What's the relationship between our project to code clone and what's the difference?Is the literature search likely to have covered all relevant studies(How can we prove that it's a thorough study of the problem)?Did the reviewers assess the quality/validity of the included studies? (e.g. citations counts, recency)Were the basic data/studies adequately described? Are we able to get the original data instead of second hand analysis?3. Start up exercise and competency proof:Create a Hello-World eclipse plug-in/plug-in extension and push it to the branch."
