## Telemetry

In the next part of our evaluation, we will be present our three solutions to the users and ask them to do the multi-step task again but this time using our products. We will be test on all our previous users and additionally we will be test it on some new users. We will try to find out if the users found our application useful for these kind of task or will they still prefer to use Google applications. We would also ask them to categorize the features in our applications as novel/interesting/useful. Finally we will ask the users to rate which application out of the three was the most useful and collect suggestions as to how the layout, views and functionalities of each of our applications can be improved.
