### Usability studies on Google Applications

#### Abstract:
To identify the potential usability problems of Google appli-
cations, a multi-step task was given to 20 users. On comple-
tion of the task, the users were asked to fill a survey with five
questions. In all, several usability problems were identified
and a qualitative description of the problems is provided.
We suggested some solutions for the problems and closed
the paper with a discussion of what we plan to do in the
upcoming months.
