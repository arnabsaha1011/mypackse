### Usability studies on Google Applications

#### Abstract:
To identify the potential usability problems of Google appli-
cations, a multi-step task was given to 20 users. On comple-
tion of the task, the users were asked to fill a survey with five
questions. In all, several usability problems were identified
and a qualitative description of the problems is provided.
We suggested some solutions for the problems and closed
the paper with a discussion of what we plan to do in the
upcoming months.

#### Abstract:
To identify the potential usability problems of Google applications, a multi-step task was given to 20 users. On completion of the task, the users were asked to fill a survey with five questions. In all, several usability problems were identified and we suggested some solutions for the problems. In the next two months, two web applications and an android application was developed using the user suggestions. Further we conducted user tests with 60 participants on the three applications and conducted a post survey to collect the user experience. Finally we ran statistical analysis and used Multi-criteria decision making methods on the data to show that one of the solutions was empirically better than the other two.
