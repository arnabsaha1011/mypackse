Goals:
To find the nearest, cheapest parking lot from a place

Data Collection:
i. Parking lots in the map
ii. Capacity
iii. Price
iv. NCSU students/ NCSU employees/ Guests
iv. Free time
v. Price at different time
vi. Traffic on the way to parking lot
vii. Number of cars parked at 'x' time

Data analysis:
i. Which parking lot: is the most used
ii. one wants to use and is using instead
iii. probability of a parking lot to be full at a particular time
iv. If a person finds a parking lot full, he or she can inform the app. This will prevent the app to point that parking lot in the next half an hour or so.
