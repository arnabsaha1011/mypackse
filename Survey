Your friend is flying from California to New York and has a layover at Raleigh for 8 hours.
Her flight lands at 1pm and her flight to NY is at 9pm.
She wants to visit a couple of places in Raleigh.
She will have lunch and an early dinner with you.
You assume that you have taken the day off and you will be assisting her in the trip all the time.
Plan a itinerary for the 8 hours.
