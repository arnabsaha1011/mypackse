## Summary

In the month of January,  we read several research papers on usability tests on different  applications. Then we decided to do the survey on Google applications as it is used by millions of users throughout the world and several of its applications provide an API to develop over their applications. Subsequently we prepared a multi-step task and an accompanied survey where the users can provide their feedback. The survey proved to be really helpful as we found several usability issues with Google search and maps. Then we discussed about the problems the users faced and came up with three solution. In the month of February and March we developed three solutions. The first two solutions were developed using HTML and JS whereas the third solution was developed in Android Studio using Java. Then the users used our applications to conduct a similar user test and we noted the user experience. Finally we proved empirically that solution 2 provided the best overall user experience.
